📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Projects

A collection of real-world analytical case studies demonstrating data cleaning, visualization, and insight generation using Python.

📁 Project Overview

This repository contains three end-to-end Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) projects across different industries—technology, hospitality, and healthcare. Each project showcases structured data preprocessing, visual analytics, and actionable insights.

🔹 1. App Insights Analysis (Google Play Store Dataset)

Imagine working as a data analyst for a tech company specializing in mobile applications. The company has acquired a dataset from the Google Play Store containing app details such as category, ratings, reviews, size, installs, and more.
The goal of this analysis is to derive insights that can help:

Improve app development strategies

Enhance user experience

Identify factors influencing app popularity

Boost app downloads and revenue

This project covers:
✔ Data cleaning & preprocessing
✔ Feature engineering
✔ Trend analysis of ratings and installs
✔ Visual insights on category performance
✔ Recommendations for product teams

🔹 2. Hotel Operations Analysis (Hotel Booking Dataset)

Elite Hotels International, a leading brand in the hospitality sector, faces operational challenges in understanding customer booking patterns and satisfaction levels. With multiple properties across regions, optimizing operations requires deeper insights from booking data.

This analysis aims to:

Understand booking trends over time

Analyze guest behavior and preferences

Identify factors contributing to cancellations

Provide insights for improving occupancy and revenue

Key workflows include:
✔ Handling missing and inconsistent data
✔ Seasonal booking trend analysis
✔ Market segment performance evaluation
✔ Cancellation rate analysis
✔ Insight-driven operational recommendations

🔹 3. Heart Health Analysis (Heart Disease Dataset)

Heart disease remains one of the leading causes of mortality worldwide, and understanding key risk factors is critical for early prediction and prevention.
This project focuses on analyzing a medical dataset containing patient health indicators such as cholesterol levels, resting blood pressure, chest pain type, exercise-induced angina, and more.

Objectives:

Identify key features correlated with heart disease

Compare health patterns between affected and non-affected patients

Visualize distributions, patterns, and anomalies

Derive data-driven insights for health monitoring

Includes:
✔ Statistical summaries
✔ Correlation heatmaps
✔ Risk factor exploration
✔ Health outcome comparison charts
